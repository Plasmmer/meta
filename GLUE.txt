Compuledger
- Unit: $COM
- DDNs - Dcntr Dmcrt Nts (the solution against crypto anarchy/neoliberalism)
- Constitution
- Use .sh for smart-contracts
- Accounts work like smart-contracts, and can have inbox and spam box for tokens and NFTs
- Sharding
- Validate a month, prg previous (can decrease to bi-week or week according to demand)

Creammy
- Lock AXS, SLP and ETH on Ronin,
get GAXS, GSLP, and GETH on Glue
- Transfer GAXS, GSLP, and GETH from Glue to XDai and back (to Glue or Ronin)
- Transfer GAXS, GSLP, and GETH to Ethereum (from Glue, Ronin or XDai) with a special trick, directly using Ronin to transfer L2 > L1
- Transfer AXS, SLP and ETH to Ronin, or directly to Glue
- Transfer XDai bridged tokens back to Ethereum
- Transfer tokens from Ethereum to XDai and back
- Transfer tokens from Ethereum to Glue and back

GLUE - optimisticalRollup and crosschain solution - mix between Optimism and Polkadot/Cosmos
- BrightID as main account (not using keypairs), connct with IDX (ID) + Circles (WoT+Sybil/Byzant resist) (IDX and Circles use Ethereum/XDai)
- Wrap ETH > GETH
- Send GETH to other GLUE accts
- Sidechains for GLUE regions
- Centralized and decentralized validators in different layers, tackling scaling/speed+security
- Validators earns GLUE
- Send GETH on Bitcoin
- Sidechains for Ethereum and Bitcoin

- Smart-contracts (comp is on GLUE and data is on Ethereum/Bitcoin - EVM-compatible API)

- Wrap NFTs, use on Bitcoin

- Wrap BTC using TBTC>GBTC
- Send GBTC to other GLUE accts
- Send GBTC on Ethereum

- Use OmniLink for tracking XDAI/IDC bridged tokens from ETH (also list their exchanges)
- Use OmniLink for tracking XDAI bridged NFTs (POAP)

grphn
- Sibling of SharedChain
- Secured by ETH+IDChain
- Free to move from IDChain
- Nodes/validators have the responsibility of their reputation/identity
- Servers can start an centralized, upgradeable sidechain (with rules to be validated and functions/conditions/actions)
- Use C instead of Eidi for gas fees
